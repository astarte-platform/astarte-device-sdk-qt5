 * @brief A pending asynchronous operation
 *
 * This class tracks a pending asynchronous operation. Hemera is designed
 * to work on fully asynchronous models or over IPC calls; Operation allows
 * to track asynchronous operations (such as a pending IPC call or a delayed
 * initialization) through a nice job-based model.
 *
 * Operations, once created, are started immediately. Though, it is safe
 * to perform connections and setups right after an Operation's creationm as
 * the starting procedure will be triggered as soon as the event loop returns.
 *
 * Various subclasses specialize in specific return types. When @ref finished
 * is emitted, the Operation can be evaluated and the result can be extracted.
 * When the operation finishes, it is automatically garbage collected, and after
 * the result recollection the object should be considered dead. Likewise, Operation
 * must not be deleted explicitly by the user.

     * retrieved from the Operation object once this method returns.

     *       returns the result of the operation nonetheless.
     *
     * @note If synchronize times out, the Operation won't fail or will be stopped. If you set a
     *       timeout and synchronize returns false, you should be checking @ref isFinished to
     *       make sure the Operation has failed or timed out synchronizing.

     *       it is not part of the advised paradigm of development in Hemera Qt5, which
     *       strives to be as asynchronous as possible. If you are using Qt5 SDK directly,
     *       connecting to @ref finished is usually the advised choice.
